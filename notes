sa (swap stack_a[0] and stack_a[1]
Change value "position"
- store pointer to a[1] in temp variable
- set pointer a[1] to a[0]
- set pointer a[0] to temp

I also need to determine:
1. what each node's position in the list is (int current_position)
2. what is closer, the "top" or the "bottom" (bool upper_half)
3. final position, meaning when we know all the values, what index should it end up being placed in stack_a
4. Using the current position and the final position, we can determine the "push_price" which should dictate the order

final_position should only be calculated once, after all nodes have been created and added to stack_a successfully.
current_position only needs to be calculated after a value has been pushed between stacks (pa or pb). I likely need to scan both stacks, unless I throw away the idea of indexes, and instead consider height as a way to determine position
